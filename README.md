How To Run
-----------

Standard stuff. Download all the files inot a single directory and make the
py file executable with 

```bash
chmod +x
```

Execute the **bounce.py** file and start playing


How To Play
-----------

Simple enough. Press the space bar when the white line is between the two 
red lines.

You'll hear a ding if you got it right, or a buzzer if you got it wrong.
Don't let the bar bounce on the top and the bottom, otherwise you lose.
