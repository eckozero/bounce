###Requirements

You'll need pygame for this. On *buntu, you can get this by running

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-pygame
```

On Windows you can download an executable from the [Pygame website](http://www.pygame.org)


###How To Run

Standard stuff. Download all the files into a single directory and make the
py file executable with 

```bash
chmod +x
```

Execute the `bounce.py` file and start playing


###How To Play

Simple enough. Press the space bar when the white line is between the two 
red lines.

You'll hear a ding if you got it right, or a buzzer if you got it wrong.
Don't let the bar bounce on the top and the bottom if your score is higher 
than one, otherwise you lose.
